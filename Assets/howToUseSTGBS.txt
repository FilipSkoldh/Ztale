A quick guide to use Stellas Totally Great Battle System

this guide will teach how to make new encounters and enemies for STGBS

to make a new enemy start by copying the baseEnemy prefab 

in base enemy relay change 
 * hp and max hp to suitable numbers
 * add acts (acts are what the options in the acing menu are called)
 * add the act descriptions
 * in the act descripting list add the descriptions for when you do something that progresses the spare acts starting with the last one
 * add the acts that are needed to be done starting with the last one 0 = hit 1 = miss 2 = acts
 * chose if the enemy will spare the player (if not do still add one spare act)

in base enemy lines
 * add what the enemy will say starting with hit, then miss, then all acts, then spare acts (last first)

 after that add a child empty (always keep canvas first) this will be a bodypart of the enemy 
 add the sprite for the body part 
 add a enemy hitbox 
 add a suitable collider make it trigger
 do this for all body parts

 add idle animtion and attack animations
 make a script with methods for attacks animations
 
 make a attack script that inheirets from BaseEnemyAttacks that plays the right animations for the encounter

 to make a new encounter add all needed enemy prefabs to battle manager 
 make a new case for the awake switch that spawns all enemies and adds the attackscript
 make a new case for the win switch in update probably somethings based on enemy states

 done :3

 see zombie for exemple and encounter 0
